# Understanding EJS Templating: Dynamic Web Pages Made Easy

EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a simple templating engine that lets you generate HTML markup with JavaScript. It's perfect for creating dynamic web pages with server-side rendering, making it an excellent choice for traditional web applications.

## What is EJS?

EJS is a templating engine that allows you to embed JavaScript code directly into your HTML templates. It processes templates on the server-side, generating static HTML that's sent to the browser.

### Key Features:
- Simple syntax similar to HTML
- Embedded JavaScript support
- Partials and includes
- Layout support
- Client-side compatibility

## Setting Up EJS with Express

First, let's set up EJS in an Express application:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Set EJS as the view engine
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.set('views', './views');

// Serve static files
app.use(express.static('public'));

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
